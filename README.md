# Tailify Play / Kittengram

This App consumes devtest.tailify.com API in order to display a bunch of kittens. ;)

* If you click on the image, details will be posted in the pastebin through devtest.tailify.com API.
* Also there is a simple Campaign Report visualization on a separate page (thanks to [react-router](https://github.com/ReactTraining/react-router)).

## Setup

You have to setup the project first

* `yarn` will install all of the packages.
* `yarn start` will start the `webpack-dev-server` and the app will be available on http://localhost:3000/

I spent about 11 hours to build the Kittengram. Almost half of them ware spent for building the charts with D3 lib - [recharts](https://github.com/recharts/recharts/) (thank you guys, recharts is awesome).
